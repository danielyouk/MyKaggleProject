# Detailed Overview: Yale_UNC-CH Geophysical Waveform Inversion Competition

This document provides a detailed overview of the Yale_UNC-CH Geophysical Waveform Inversion competition, based on information from the official competition page.

## Competition Goal

The primary objective is to **estimate subsurface properties, specifically velocity maps, from seismic waveform data**. This process is known as **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)**. Success in this competition could lead to more accurate and efficient seismic analysis, with applications in energy exploration, carbon storage, medical ultrasound, and advanced material testing.

## Core Problem: Advancing Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)

FWI is a powerful technique for creating detailed images of the Earth's subsurface by analyzing the entire shape (waveform) of seismic waves. However, current FWI methodologies face significant challenges:

*   **Traditional Physics-Based FWI:** While capable of high accuracy, these methods are computationally intensive (slow) and can be prone to errors when dealing with noisy data or weak signals.
*   **Pure Machine Learning (ML) FWI:** ML solutions can be faster but typically require vast amounts of labeled training data. They also often struggle to generalize to new geological settings or signal characteristics not well-represented in the training set.

This competition challenges participants to **bridge the gap by combining physics-informed principles with machine learning techniques** to create robust and efficient FWI solutions.

## Technical Approach

Participants are encouraged to develop novel approaches that integrate domain knowledge from physics (e.g., wave propagation equations) with the pattern-recognition strengths of machine learning. This could involve:
*   Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
*   Using ML to accelerate or regularize traditional physics-based inversion.
*   Developing ML models that are inherently more generalizable due to physics-based constraints.
*   Hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

## Key Tasks for Participants

1.  **Understand FWI Principles:** Grasp the underlying physics of wave propagation and seismic inversion.
2.  **Data Handling & Preprocessing:** Work with seismic waveform datasets, which can be complex and require careful preparation.
3.  **Model Development:** Design and implement models that effectively combine physics and machine learning.
4.  **Training & Optimization:** Train models on the provided data and optimize them for performance based on the evaluation metric.
5.  **Prediction & Submission:** Generate predictions in the specified format for the test dataset.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** across all columns and rows in the predicted velocity maps.

### Submission File Format

For each `oid_ypos` (a unique identifier combined with a vertical position/row index) in the test set, you must predict a value for each **odd-indexed `x_` column** (e.g., `x_1, x_3, ..., x_69`).

The submission file must:
1.  Contain a header row.
2.  Follow the format: `oid_ypos,x_1,x_3,...,x_69`
3.  Example rows:
    ```
    oid_ypos,x_1,x_3,...,x_69
    000039dca2_y_0,3000.0,3000.0,...,3000.0
    000039dca2_y_1,3000.0,3000.0,...,3000.0
    000039dca2_y_2,3000.0,3000.0,...,3000.0
    etc.
    ```
4.  Predictions for each `oid` should be stacked.

## Typical Deliverables

*   A submission file in the specified CSV format containing predictions for the test set.
*   Potentially, code and documentation explaining the developed solution, especially for top-ranking participants.
