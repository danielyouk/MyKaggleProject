## Competition Context: Yale_UNC-CH Geophysical Waveform Inversion

This project is for the **Yale_UNC-CH Geophysical Waveform Inversion** competition.
The primary goal is to **estimate subsurface properties, specifically velocity maps, from seismic waveform data** using a process known as **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)**.

FWI is a powerful technique for imaging the Earth's subsurface, crucial for applications like energy exploration, carbon storage, and even medical ultrasound. However, traditional physics-based FWI methods can be slow and struggle with noisy data, while pure machine learning approaches often require vast labeled datasets and may not generalize well to new geological scenarios ("signals").

This competition challenges participants to **bridge this gap by combining physics-informed approaches with machine learning** to advance FWI. The aim is to develop methods that are both accurate and efficient, capable of handling noisy real-world data.

**Evaluation:** Submissions are evaluated on the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. The submission requires predicting values for specific (odd-indexed) spatial columns for each unique identifier and vertical position.

For a more detailed breakdown of the competition, including evaluation specifics and data format, please refer to the `docs/competition_overview.md` file and the official Kaggle competition page.
